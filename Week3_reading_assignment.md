According to Rachel, the definition of Open Street maps is people adding information about the places they know. This is a wonderful concept because it is open information and people can have easy access. As shown by Rachel, these maps are helpful in times of crisis like natural disasters. I think that using this data for humanitarian causes is wonderful and is really a manifestation of mutual aid. However, the privacy of people might be endangered and used for bad purposes. Because everyone with access to Internet can edit these maps, it is likely that someone can put personal information of other people on it. Therefore, the job of the validators is extremely important. And there is also the chance that the validators use some private information with bad intention, too. Therefore, despite the benefits of open street maps, the data lack protection.

I think that open data can be used in many ways to make the world a better place. However, I also recognize that a lot of the most vulnerable societies in the world do not have access to Internet and it is often people from other communities that come to collect their information. This could be a potential problem because some communities might not want to be pressured to appear on maps. And more exposure means that their culture might be endangered.
