Reading "Mapping Events/Mapping Social Media" was a unique experience for me. While I have heard about the HyperCities Now project, I have never connected it to Digital Humaniites – to what we are learning now. I appreciate how the chapter mentions the ability of Digital Humanities to motivate social change. Accorrding to the authors, DH is expansive in many different contexts. For example, it breaks down the traditional boundaries surrounding and within different fields in academia; it does not just record the past but poses questions into the future. 

Reading the chapter about Tehran, I was impressed by how much thinking was put into the project. Mainly, it was crucial to create an integrated time-stamped map that shows all kinds of media people were posting. This is crucial because, while we can look at different mediums separately, putting them together and examining them can yield unexpected results and effects. This was enabled by HyperCities Now and the project successfully demonstrated a narrative different from the of the government. While reading this, I realized the importance to act quickly when problems arise – it would be better if we can predict some problems in the future and have existing structures in hand to respond quickly to events.
