My name is Haiqi (she/her) and I'm a third year double majoring in French and Art History. Through this class, I would like to learn more about how to analyze and present data through coding :) I enjoy diving in my free time and I'm wondering if I'd be able to analyze some data about human activities affecting marine lives (I'm not sure if it counts as "humanities").
